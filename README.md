# CV-Sida

## Overview
This repository contains the code for my personal website. The site follows clean CSS practices without Bootstrap. It features five pages with a consistent navigation menu, including a self-presentation, CV, and a portfolio of projects.

## Features
- **Navigation**: User-friendly menu for easy navigation across pages.
- **Content**: Each page includes essential content and at least one image.
- **Portfolio**: A project list with modal popups for additional details (HTML & CSS only).
- **Layout**: Multiple columns, selected fonts, and responsiveness for various screen sizes.
- **Technical Requirements**: Compatibility with modern browsers, proper HTML semantics.
- **Easter Eggs**: Two interactive surprises, one on unconventional clicks and another with a specific keyboard combination.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your preferred browser.
## Easter Eggs
Feel free to explore the Easter eggs and enjoy navigating through the content!  
Try to find the button to toggle dark-mode and try typing "1337", "Aldor" and "Arnar" when on the page.
